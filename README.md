# No More Directive Chaos.

## Directives you can actually read.

Avoid missing information or poorly formatted directives using a guided form entry. Read beautiful UI font instead of deciphering terrible handwriting. Standardize directive formats to make them quickly skimmable instead of searching a crumpled sheet for randomly placed directive details.

_Why decipher terrible handwriting? Use MUNSuite and read beautiful UI font instead._

## Automatic Status Communication.

Lost, damaged or forgotten directives all leave the delegate hanging; did their directive pass or fail? Every time you update a private directive, you have to write a note back and wait for it to get passed to the directive author. Is this really the right way to handle status communication?

_Bring MUN out of the stone age and into the 21st century. Use the internet, not messengers._

## Individual Statistics Collection.

Let the cold, hard numbers show you who is leading the committee, who passes the most directives, and who isn't contributing. All done behind the scenes, with no effort; we'll crunch the numbers this time.

Note-take on delegate performance individually and filter for specific delegates' notes when making specific comparisons. Collaborate with other dais members and export your notes anytime.

## A Directives History Page.

Paper directives: you see them, then toss them. Skip the forgetting and maintain a history of all processed directives. Filter for passed directives to see a summary of your committee's actions. Search for a specific one to refresh your memory.

_If it wasn't recorded, did it really happen?_
