# No More Directive Chaos.

## Directives you can actually read.

<p>Avoid missing information or poorly formatted directives using a guided form entry. Read beautiful UI font instead of deciphering terrible handwriting. Standardize directive formats to make them quickly skimmable instead of searching a crumpled sheet for randomly placed directive details.

_Why decipher terrible handwriting? Use MUNSuite and read beautiful UI font instead._</p>

## Automatic Status Communication.

<p>Lost, damaged or forgotten directives all leave the delegate hanging; did their directive pass or fail? Every time you update a private directive, you have to write a note back and wait for it to get passed to the directive author. Is this really the right way to handle status communication?

<p>Let the cold, hard numbers show you who is leading the committee, who passes the most directives, and who isn't contributing. All done behind the scenes, with no effort; we'll crunch the numbers this time.

<p>Note-take on delegate performance individually and filter for specific delegates' notes when making specific comparisons. Collaborate with other dais members and export your notes anytime.</p>

## A Directives History Page.

<p>Paper directives: you see them, then toss them. Skip the forgetting and maintain a history of all processed directives. Filter for passed directives to see a summary of your committee's actions. Search for a specific one to refresh your memory.

_If it wasn't recorded, did it really happen?_</p>
